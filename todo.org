* DONE Rotate Initial quaternion according to yaw
* DONE Testing C++ code
* DONE Preprocess test data sets
* DONE settle. create initial position.
* DONE Create Unit tests
** unit test for settling, add a plot
** DONE Unit Test to confirm symmetry of the tire network
* DONE Train a New Network
Fuck. How should I architect this network.
Final Layer should be ReLU * Tanh(sign corection)
This enforces the basic rule of friction, that it opposes movement
** <2023-04-02 Sun 00:04>
I trained a new network, it uses relu, tanh, and sigmoid to make sure everything
crosses zero at zero and everything is continuous. Based.
I created unit tests to visualize the C++ implementation using matplotlib in cpp.
It matches the python plots, at least visually, I didn't actually compare the
numbers lol I just eyeballed it but it's probably good.
I'm surprised "eyeballing it" has an application in programming
* DONE Now that we have the network, S I M U L A T E
** DONE Create some unit tests
Create unit tests for basic simulations
Like moving forward along a straight line,
Moving in a circle
beautiful. So smooth and nice
** DONE Experiment with different settling damping hacks
Check the straight line performance with different settling haxx
Didn't see much difference when changing the damping value from
like -200 to -1000
** DONE Nate dogg and Warren G had to S I M U L A T E
So its settling and driving straight in a circle.
Lets evaluate the untrained performance on the test data sets.
* TODO TRAIN NO WORKO
This is bad, because basically it's a brickwall if I can't get
around it somehow. I tried the most basic form of the problem.
I trained one parameter. The loss blew up and the param -> nan.
I trained one parameter and took an average over 10 trajectories. The loss blew up and the param -> nan.
I trained one parameter and took an average over 100 trajectories. The loss blew up and the param -> nan.
1 param, 100 traj, 2s traj, replace floats with double: param->nan

So, this is not working because for some rare trajectories, the value of the gradient inexplicably explodes.
* TODO Exclude outlier gradient magnitudes
* DONE Running Loss? Didn't kill gradient explosions
* DONE Try smaller timestep? This actually seems like it works. WTF.
This seems to actually solve the problem fuck. But its too slow.
God damn it. Still some gradient explosions magnitude 1.
* DONE Identify the source of gradient explosions?
It could be that some part of it is not lipshitz, or it could
just be the general gradient variance problem that they talk
about in the paper "Gradients are not all you need"
It's caused by inverses, and division. Basically any
non-lipshitz component.
* DONE Adjust the small constant added to division?
in slip ratio and slip angle.
This fucking worked. It got rid of the 1e18 bullshit
but it still varies from 1e-6 to 1 which is atrocious
* New Network with non-lipshitz components eliminated?
Replace slip angle with Vy, replace slip ratio with vx - tire_tangent_vel
I'm not sure this would solve all the problems
* Colocation method (train derivatives)
Cheating. But simple and apparently works
Alternatively, just use very small trajectory length, I think.
I don't think colocation is going to work here because the real
data is too noisy. I would have to compute target derivatives
using finite differences which would be way too noisy.
* DONE Smaller duration trajectories
No Effect. Even with 2 points (smallest trajectory possible)
The gradient still explodes up to 1e18.
But now I can make a unit test to replicate this behavior and
find the source of it.

* DONE Euler vs RK4?
Idk why not.
Nope still explosive

* TODO Unit test to replicate exploding gradient

* DONE OH FUCK I WAS RETARDED AND MADE IT disCONTINUOUS OH SHIDDDDD
This will probably not solve the gradient-splosions.
Need to remove the discontinuity where Fz == 0 when zr < 0
